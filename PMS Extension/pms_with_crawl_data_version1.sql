Introduction In recent years, Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs) [8, 16] have garnered significant interest as an elegant alternative for addressing concurrency issues in memory. STM systems take optimistic approach. Multiple transactions are allowed to execute concurrently. On completion, each transaction is validated and if any inconsistency is observed it is aborted. Otherwise it is allowed to commit. An important requirement of STM systems is to precisely iden- tify the criterion as to when a transaction should be aborted/committed.
